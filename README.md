## Course Overview

In an era of rapid technological advancements and data-driven decision-making, mastering research methodologies is essential for economics and politics students. This course aims to equip you with the necessary tools, ethical principles, and practical skills to conduct rigorous research. Whether you’re preparing to write an undergraduate-level essay, preparing a graduation thesis, or contributing to academic discourse, this course will help you navigate the complexities of modern research.

This course is designed for the economics and politics students who need formal education in responsible research methodologies before they start to write a thesis or academic article. The goal of the course is to allow students to understand better the significance of academic honesty in economics and politics in the age of AI. Students will be informed about the harmful consequences of immoral behaviour at universities, such as cheating, plagiarism, data manufacturing, and manipulation. Students will also be introduced to a selection of software (such as Zotero, Gemini, and NotebookLM) and digital platforms (such as Google Scholar and Elicit). At the end of the course, students will acquire the necessary skills to draft an original research proposal and conduct research independently.

Remember, research methodologies are not static; they evolve alongside technology and societal needs. Embrace the journey of discovery, uphold academic integrity, and contribute meaningfully to the fields of economics and politics.
