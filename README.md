## Course Overview (improved and extenden by CoPilot)

In an era of rapid technological advancements and data-driven decision-making, mastering
research methodologies is essential for economics and politics students. This course aims to
equip you with the necessary tools, ethical principles, and practical skills to conduct rigorous
research. Whether you‚Äôre preparing to write an undergraduate level essay, prepare a
graduation thesis, or contribute to academic discourse, this course will empower you to
navigate the complexities of modern research.

This course is designed for the economics and politics students who need formal education
in responsible research methodologies before they start to write a thesis or academic article.
The goal of the course is to allow students to have an understanding of the significance of
academic honesty in economics and politics in the age of AI. Students will be informed about the harmful consequences of immoral behaviour at universities (such as cheating,
plagiarism, data manufacturing, and data manipulation). Students will also be introduced to a selection of software (such as Zotero and ChatGPT) and digital platforms (such as Google
Scholar and Elicit). At the end of the course, students will acquire the necessary skills to
draft an original research proposal and conduct research independently.

Remember, research methodologies are not static; they evolve alongside technology and
societal needs. Embrace the journey of discovery, uphold academic integrity, and contribute
meaningfully to the fields of economics and politics. üåüüìäüîç
